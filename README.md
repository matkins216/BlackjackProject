# Background
Blackjack is a casino table game played with standard playing cards not including jokers. The goal of the game is to get to a score of 21 without going over 21. The opposing player is the dealer and their goal is to hit 21 or get a higher score than the player.

To start: click a value to bet before hitting the 'deal' button. Once you have made your play, the 'stand' button allows the dealer to play their hand. When the hand is over, click the 'NEXT HAND' button to log your results and stats. Play a new hand by placing another bet before dealing.

# Next Steps
- add split functionality
- allow a 2nd Ace card to have a value of 1 or to place a button upon the dealing of cards to decide Ace's value
- end the game when bankroll reaches 0
- do not allow bets over the bankroll value
- have a buy in button when initial bankroll hits 0
